## üîç Project Theory: Social Dynamics in Survival

This project explores the Titanic tragedy as a case study in human decision-making during crisis. Instead of just predicting who survived, we use data to understand the *why* ‚Äî what social, psychological, and structural factors influenced those outcomes?

Key concepts:
- **Social hierarchy** dictated evacuation priorities.
- **Moral codes** like ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù influenced behavior.
- **Family structure** played a tactical role in survival.
- **Access vs wealth**: Mid-range ticket holders may have had geographic advantages on the ship.
- **Intersectionality** between gender and class amplified disparities.

This theory-driven approach turns historical data into a reflection on human nature and societal response under duress.
